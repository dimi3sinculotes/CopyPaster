# CopyPaster

This is a simple java program which can work on two modes, one ignores ENTER and use it as a command to start working, and the second use ENTER as \n. All it does is to read what you write/paste in it and type it as it was your keyboard but faster.

You've got it compiled in /controlUve/Dist, and you have all the NetBeans project so you can customize it as you want, no licence, cba what you do with it, not my responsability tho
